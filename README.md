# Union Email Templates V1.0
Branded email templates for [The Students' Union at UWE] [TSU] regular newsletters and emails. Compatible with Apple, Android and Gmail clients. Oh and it works with MSL.

#### Super awesome and usefull important information that will save your life
 * Use ```style="border-top:10px solid #222;"``` to create gaps between modules. The convention is to avoid using ```border-bottom```
 *  Make sure you check the ```<title>``` and 'Visually Hidden Preheader Text' before uploading and sending. 
 *  Avoid editting these templates using the WYSIWYG editor, instead edit locally and paste the code into the template to make changes. This is because the WYSIWYG editor strips out a bunch of stuff.
 *  Make sure you test emails using the MSL preview feature. It parses the code and has been known to break things.

#### Client Support 
Cerberus which these templates are based on have been tested in the most popular email clients as reported by Litmus and their email campaigns. They have focused on the following clients:

Desktop | Web | Mobile
--- | --- | ---
Outlook 2000/02/03/07/10/13 (Windows) | Gmail | Mail (iOS)
Outlook 2011/16 (Mac) | Outlook.com  | Gmail (iOS, Android 4.4)
Apple Mail | Yahoo | Mail (Android 4.4)
Thunderbird | Aol | Mailbox (iOS)
- | Outlook Web Access | Inbox (iOS)
- | - | Yahoo (iOS)
 `When they say “tested”, they mean “email doesn’t fall apart”. They don't mean “We found a way to make media queries work in Gmail” or "Everything is pixel perfect in Outlook."`

Any client not listed above should be considered untested.
